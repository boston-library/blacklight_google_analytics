# Blacklight Google Analytics

A gem plugin which adds support for Google Analytics and event tracking to a 
[Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) application.

# Installation

1. [Install Blacklight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight)
2. Add `gem 'blacklight_google_analytics'` to your `Gemfile`
3. Run the generator: `rails g blacklight_google_analytics`
4. Edit `config/initializers/blacklight_google_analytics.rb` to include your own Google Web id.
  You will need a [Google Analytics account](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and
  profile.

# Usage

Google Analytics tracking code is only turned on in production. Both page tracking
and Blacklight-specific event tracking is turned on.

In development tracking is sent to the console log to allow you to see what parameters will
be sent to Google Analytics.

Here's an example of event tracking. This is the output to the browser console 
when clicking on the Format facet,
selecting the "Book" facet value, and then removing it:

```
["facets", "collapse_expand", "Format"]
["facets", "Format", "Book"]
["facets", "Format", "[remove]"]
```

These parameters are the category, action, and label according to the Google
Analytics [event tracking documentation](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/eventTrackerGuide.html).
This event tracking information shows up in Google Analytics under Content > Events.
